The ClaSS README
----------------

ClaSS stands for ClaSS Student System, a complete student 
tracking, reporting, and information management system for schools.

ClaSS is a working, useable version of what is to be a complete
classroom information assistant for schools.

You are referred to the ClaSS home-page http://www.laex.org/class/ for
more information and documentation. Please email stj@laex.org with
questions, requests for support, installation help etc. You can also
use the integrated suppoprt forms in the AboutBook to post queries
to the development team from inside ClaSS.

Look at the README in the subdiretory class/install for instructions
to guide you through the installation procedure.

If you already have an install of ClaSS runnning then you'll need to
migrate your database across by applying the appropriate sql-patch
scripts in the install directory (if any are needed).

Please do let stj@laex.org know if you find this software useful (or
not useful!). All feedback is valued and will help speed the
development of ClaSS.
