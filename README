The ClaSS README
----------------

ClaSS is the ClaSS Student System, a complete student 
tracking, reporting, and information management system for schools.

ClaSS was first imagined as a classroom information assistant - a
re-invention from the classroom up of more common top-down school
management systems. Thanks to the generous feedback and patience of
countless teachers, secretaries, and school administrators it has now
grown to match the functionality of those big systems but still with an
eye for the needs of the teacher.

You are referred to the ClaSS home-page http://www.laex.org/class/ for
more information and documentation. Please email stj@laex.org with
questions, requests for support, installation help etc. You can also
use the integrated suppoprt forms in the AboutBook to post queries
to the development team from inside ClaSS.

Look at the README in the subdiretory class/install for instructions
to guide you through the installation procedure.

If you already have an install of ClaSS runnning then you'll need to
migrate your database across by applying the appropriate sql-patch
scripts in the install directory (if any are more recent than your 
current install).

Please do let us know if you find this software useful (or not
useful!). All feedback is valued and will help speed the development
of ClaSS.
