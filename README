The ClaSS README
----------------

ClaSS-0.6 is a working, useable version of what is to be a complete
classroom information assistant for schools.

You are referred to the ClaSS home-page http://www.laex.org/class/ for
more information and documentation. Please email class@laex.org with
questions, requests for support, installation help etc. You can also
use the integrated suppoprt forms in the AboutBook to post queries
from inside ClaSS.

Look at the README in the subdiretory class/install for instructions
to guide you through the installation procedure.

If you already have an install of ClaSS runnning then you'll need to
migrate your database across to 0.6 by applying the sql-patch script.
This is also found in the install directory.

Please do let class@laex.org know if you find this software useful (or
not useful!). All feedback is valued and will help speed the
development of ClaSS.
