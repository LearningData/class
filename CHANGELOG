Version ClaSS-0.8.2 release (2006/11/23)
---------------------------------------------------- 

Working on the Register. Added create_register to the install process
which creates two new tables, event and attendance.

Moved commendate to a default value in commentDisplay and moved to
using mktime to do the claculation.
 
Removed the unused date variable from the User class.

Have dropped the nicetitles code in favour of the neater leaner
qTip. This means all the popup title attributes are now moved out to
span elements. All much tidier.

Added to the css and html_functions tp provide a new "selery" class
which replaces the ugly select elements on the sideoptions. Requires
two lines of javascript to work and part of the userinterface code.

Version ClaSS-0.8.1 release (2006/11/09)
---------------------------------------------------- 

Changed password to pin for the staff_details form, added list_role,
and used list_book for the firstbookpref.

Changed naming of teacher id and staff number in the entrybook.

Moved the setting of $tab=1 into the head_options.

A statement of intent, adding library, medical, and sen to the array
of user roles - even though they don't yet do anything.

Removed the limitation of needing all books enabled for the 'admin'
role by adding a non-role to the the books array called 'all'. This now
takes care of telling index.php about pre-loading all viewbooks. 

Added SENeeds book which displays just sids flagged with SEN='Y'. Uses
a new getSENPerm to allow access for pastoral and sen responsibles to
change the sen records.

Now check for admin role in report_reports and for users with more
than one pastoral responsibility.

Fixed bug in list_student_reports which caused no reports to be
displayed, and added selections ofr individual course reports as well
as report wrappers.
