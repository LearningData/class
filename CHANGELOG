Version ClaSS-0.8.8 release (2007/01/22)
----------------------------------------

The loginaside text had gone missing - it needed the
loadBookOptions("logbook") to be called at the end of login.php.

Have renamed fputcsv to be file_putcsv as it conflicts with the stock
fputcsv function in PHP5.

Version ClaSS-0.8.7 release (2007/01/19)
----------------------------------------

A bugfix to the register which fixes the completion list. It was
failing to exclude students who had left a registration group. The
leavingdate clause has been added to the check_CommunityAttendance
function.

Tracked down missing D grades in the ReportBook to scoreToGrade()
function mistaking grades with score value zero for null strings.
Now use is_numeric for scoreToGrade() and scoreToPercent().

Added Element and Derivation to the new_assessments form.

Renamed xmlpreparer to be xmlechoer and now using xmlpreparer to
return xml for use by xslt_process.

Added phonenumber to the info table and fixed the length of the email
field to 240 - needs patch-0.8.7.sql.

Use phonenumber field for 'MobilePhone' in the Student xml fields.

Email, MobilePhone and FirstContact all added to the studentfields 
displaying from the select lists in the InfoBook student list.

The padding of the span element used by qtip was causing a problem for
onhover and has bee replaced by giving the span just the width and
height of its contents - it must now have a content or qtip!

The find_sids script has a problem with matching three letter
names. Best for now is to pull out results for an exact match. But its
only a work round not a solution.

Version ClaSS-0.8.6 release (2007/01/03)
----------------------------------------

A bugfix to the register to allow the display of a fresh attendance

Version ClaSS-0.8.5 release (2006/12/20)
----------------------------------------

Added a timezone setting to $CFG and included in classdata to set for
all pages. Really only needed by the Register when the school's
timezone differs form the servers.

rowaction container to work.

Moving towards using listCommunties function in both admin and
register, to list all communities of one type.

Added completion_list to the register to list the status of
registration groups for the current event. This also uses a new xsl

an AttendanceEvent xmlarray.
 
Added simple nav buttons to the register_list to move back in time one
week at a time.

Version ClaSS-0.8.4 release (2006/12/16)

handle post and get for vars that maintain state between reloads. It
doesn't do anything extra upon var change so is currently only used in
the seneeds book.

Filtering the student_list in seneeds book by sentype, yeargroup, and
sen review date now implemented as part of the sideoptions.

Added checkeveid to the session vars in the Register, it now maintains
the selected column.

be arrays if named the same or a blank value can be passed.

Moved formfunctions to bookfunctions and userinterface to hostfunctions.
Moved viewstyle to bookstyle and parentstyle to hoststyle.

Basic absence lists added to the register.

Bug-fix to eliminate multiple assessments cells being printed. Now

which creates two new tables, event and attendance.

New javascript extension to the UI added for highlighting selected
table columns and student rows. Currently only implemented in the
register. Uses a css class "selected".

The css of the sideoptions has been cleaned up with a new class selery.

Moved commendate to a default value in commentDisplay and moved to
using mktime to do the claculation.
 
Removed the unused date variable from the User class.

Have dropped the nicetitles code in favour of the neater leaner
qTip. This means all the popup title attributes are now moved out to
span elements. All much tidier.

Added to the css and html_functions tp provide a new "selery" class
which replaces the ugly select elements on the sideoptions. Requires
two lines of javascript to work and part of the userinterface code.

Increased the length of the email field in the guardian table.

Added js for font resizing using a third sidebutton in the logbook.

Moved the setting of $tab=1 into the head_options.

A statement of intent, adding library, medical, and sen to the array
of user roles - even though they don't yet do anything.

Removed the limitation of needing all books enabled for the 'admin'
role by adding a non-role to the the books array called 'all'. This now
takes care of telling index.php about pre-loading all viewbooks. 

Added SENeeds book which displays just sids flagged with SEN='Y'. Uses
a new getSENPerm to allow access for pastoral and sen responsibles to
change the sen records.

Now check for admin role in report_reports and for users with more
than one pastoral responsibility.

Fixed bug in list_student_reports which caused no reports to be
displayed, and added selections for individual course reports as well
as report wrappers.
