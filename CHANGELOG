----------------------------------------

Moving towards using listCommunties function in both admin and
register, to list all communities of one type.

Added completion_list to the register to list the status of
registration groups for the current event. This also uses a new xsl

To allow xsl printing within the register the events have been given
an AttendanceEvent xmlarray.
 
Added simple nav buttons to the register_list to move back in time one
week at a time.

Version ClaSS-0.8.4 release (2006/12/16)

the seneeds book.

Filtering the student_list in seneeds book by sentype, yeargroup, and
sen review date now implemented as part of the sideoptions.

Added checkeveid to the session vars in the Register, it now maintains
the selected column.

Moved formfunctions to bookfunctions and userinterface to hostfunctions.
Moved viewstyle to bookstyle and parentstyle to hoststyle.

First working version of the register completed. Now records
absent or present status; when present lateness; when absent a absence code.

Added create_register to the install process
which creates two new tables, event and attendance.

New javascript extension to the UI added for highlighting selected
table columns and student rows. Currently only implemented in the
register. Uses a css class "selected".

The css of the sideoptions has been cleaned up with a new class selery.

Moved commendate to a default value in commentDisplay and moved to
using mktime to do the claculation.
 
Removed the unused date variable from the User class.

Have dropped the nicetitles code in favour of the neater leaner
qTip. This means all the popup title attributes are now moved out to
span elements. All much tidier.

Added to the css and html_functions tp provide a new "selery" class
which replaces the ugly select elements on the sideoptions. Requires
two lines of javascript to work and part of the userinterface code.

Changed naming of teacher id and staff number in the entrybook.

Moved the setting of $tab=1 into the head_options.

A statement of intent, adding library, medical, and sen to the array
of user roles - even though they don't yet do anything.

Removed the limitation of needing all books enabled for the 'admin'
role by adding a non-role to the the books array called 'all'. This now
takes care of telling index.php about pre-loading all viewbooks. 

Added SENeeds book which displays just sids flagged with SEN='Y'. Uses
a new getSENPerm to allow access for pastoral and sen responsibles to
change the sen records.

Now check for admin role in report_reports and for users with more
than one pastoral responsibility.

Fixed bug in list_student_reports which caused no reports to be
displayed, and added selections for individual course reports as well
as report wrappers.
