This is the INSTALL README for ClaSS-0.8 (last updated 17/07/2006)

For further help or advice refer to the 
ClaSS homepage: http://www.laex.org/class/ 
or email your support query to: class@laex.org

------------------------------ 
(0) ClaSS uses PHP and MySQL. It is assumed you already have these
correctly installed on your webserver and that you have full
command-line access to the server. 

In addition, the PEAR libraries for PHP are used. The PEAR:DB package
is essential. The PEAR:XML_Serializer package is also needed if you
intend to use any of the ClaSS features that use XML such as printing
reports.

The versions of these packages you are running is probably not so
important as long as they are not acient. ClaSS-0.6 is known to work with
the following:

PEAR::DB 1.6.2
PHP 4.3.10-13
Apache 1.3.33
MySQL 4.0.24

and has been reported running happily runnning on higher versions
including MySQL 4.1.x, MySQL 5.0.22 and PHP 4.4.x. It is yet to be 
tested with PHP5. Please do let us know about your successes and failures.

------------------------------ 
(1) Locating the application in your webspace.

(1.1) Create a toplevel directory in your webspace, the name of which
will be the name users see when accessing your ClaSS
site. eg. /var/www/class-site/

(1.2) Move the ClaSS.tar package into this toplevel directory.
And unpack the tarball. eg. tar -xvf ClaSS.tar

(1.3) Unpacking created the class directory under which all
application files exist. In addition an installtion directory (class/install) 
includes all the files needed to install and configure the database. The 
following files from the install directory need to be moved to be in your top-level 
directory:
	mv install/toplevel/index.html .
	mv install/toplevel/school.php .  
	mv install/toplevel/images .  
	mv install/toplevel/toplevel/templates .
	mv install/toplevel/toplevel/curriculum.tar .

These files, located outside the class application directory, are not automatically 
replaced when ClaSS is next updated. This procedure is intended to preserve any
school-spcefic changes you make to these top-level files.

(1.4) "Curriculum Packs" are used to define codes for subjects and courses, 
yeargroups and forms, and to setup some predefined types of marks. The 
English National Curriculum pack is the default one (if anyone wishes to
contribute alternatives, please do!). This needs to be unpacked in the
toplevel directory:
	tar -xvf curriculum.tar

(1.5) Edit school.php, following the inline comments, to make it 
relevant to your installation. 

------------------------------ 
(2) Preparing MySQL for the first time (if you already have a mysql
user this won't be neccessary).

(2.1) Run mysql as root user at the command line: 
	mysql

(2.2) Add a user:
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.*
    ->     TO username@localhost
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

(2.3) Make sure root gets a password if they haven't already:
      SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD('new_password');

(2.4) exit

------------------------------ 
(3) Installing the empty database and connection script.

(3.1) Ensure that the toplevel directory is writable by the
webserver. This can be done most simply (if insecurely!) by executing
the command:
		 chmod 777 /var/www/class-site 

Be warned! You must change this setting back once the install script
has been run or else you risk leaving your site wide open to security
issues. Probably you need:
		 chmod 755 /var/www/class-site 

(3.2) Run the install script by pointing your browser at:
		http://localhost/class-site/class/install/ 

(3.3) You will be asked to supply the MySQL user detials you just
set-up above. If it fails go back to (3.1) and check the directory
permissions are set so the webserver script is allowed to write to the
class-site directory.

(3.4) If you used chmod in step (3.1) then make sure you use it again
now. Change the settings back to how they were using something like:
		chmod 755 /var/www/class-site

------------------------------ 
(4) Test all is working. 

(4.1) Point your browser at http://localhost/class-site/ and use
username:administrator and password:(the MySQL connect password you gave
above).

(4.2) For security I'd recommend removing the install directory once all
is working. And check the permissions of the webspace are secure.

(4.3) Read the ClaSS Administrator's Guide
(http://www.laex.org/adminguide.html) to get yourself started on
populating the database for your school.

------------------------------ 
(5) Send an email (to class@laex.org) with feedback or just to say
you've given ClaSS a try. All your comments and encouragement help in making
ClaSS a better piece of software.
